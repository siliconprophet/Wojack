# Wojack
 This is some code I saw in a dream. 
 
 In the dream I was back in college taking a computer science course. Being one about AI emotions everyone had to write a paper about their feelings because the university judged that computer science students were too autistic to be able to comprehend emotions without this course. It was a graduation requirement and a prerequisite for all AI related courses.
 
 Then I woke up and had sleep paralysis as Doomer girl was forcing me down. I was in bed screaming at 4am and then fell back asleep.
 
 Then I was back in class and decided to hide in a box and write code instead of writing about my feelings. So I set the value of lies_truth to -2,147,483,648 and let my chatbot go crazy. It wrote all my papers for me and got me a contract with the CIA for something. Also the liar Wojack image was Asian but covered their skin with cement to appear white and told everyone that they didn't have Coronavirus and was gay. 
 
 Then it went to a first person perspective of Liar Wojack doing some kind of 3d platformer involving breaking into a warehouse with members of the Truth class being things it needed to avoid. Then it left the building and did Mirror's Edge style platforming around a city before I woke up.
